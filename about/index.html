The name—a portmanteau of &ldquo;monk&rdquo; and &ldquo;bootstrapping&rdquo;<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>—means &ldquo;creating online businesses to fund a life of intellectual exploration.&rdquo;<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup> Originally, I thought the blog would be about that.</p><p>Now, the blog is just about topics that interest me, with no particular unifying theme. Many articles are about technology, philosophy, or literature. I still like the name, though, so I publish here.</p><p>I write this blog pseudonymously but not fanatically so. My name is not on the site, but I send links to friends without hiding my authorship. This half-hearted layer of indirection is simply meant to lower the mental hurdle of publishing my thoughts publicly.</p><p>I started a blog for several reasons.</p><p>First, writing helps me understand things better. Sometimes, I think I understand something well until I try to explain it and find that I can&rsquo;t.<sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup> Writing helps me work through that.</p><p>Second, writing helps me communicate with others more clearly. Sometimes, I get excited about a book or concept but struggle to articulate why, especially in casual conversation. Writing helps me understand why and rehearse the explanation.</p><p>Third, writing creates a record of something that was important to me, at least at some point, and would otherwise fade. I explore lots of ideas, but I soon forget all but the most basic details. Writing creates a record I can revisit in the future without necessarily revisiting the source material. I can also share the record with others if they take a deeper interest in one of the topics.</p><p>Finally, writing helps balance mindless content consumption with the discipline of content creation. I hope this will lengthen my attention span and strengthen my critical thinking skills.</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>In a business context, &ldquo;bootstrapping&rdquo; means starting a business without outside funding.&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:2><p>Yes, I know this is a bit groan-inducing as I write this in 2022, with the ethos of Tim Ferriss et al having seeped osmotically into popular culture.
